# Discord-Roles-Claim
A Discord bot that assists in assigning roles after users pm their wallet address to the bot, made in 2020

**(In archiving this bot, it was found that the newest version was lost so the function is slightly different than described. But should be easy to re-implment after modification.)**

**Note that the bot is developed on Replit, so the libraries used are Replit specific!**

## index.js

It is the main running file. It includes several testing features: replying, pulling quotes from website, detecting & removing erc20 wallet address in server chatroom. $addrole command allows addition of \[role\] to \[member\].

## server.js

To keep the bot alive 24/7 on Replit for free, [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) can be used to ping web server.
